* __doublecmd__: Split screen file explorer (We use rofi for that)
* __dunst__: Replacement for notification demons provided by most packages 
* __epdfview__: Lightweight pdfviewer (a good alternative would be Zathura) or more feature rich but also way more heavy 
because it needs a lot of kde packages) would be oracle

## Installed Software Extra Explaination
